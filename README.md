# Dragongame

A game to kill an evil dragon, in Python 3. The version in the main branch is similar to the one in the "Tests" branch, with a few fixes, but other ideas were under implementation. Therefore, the version in "Tests2" branch is incomplete. At the moment, this project works if you download this project from the main branch and run the "Dragon_game.py" script.

However, this project is not receiving updates.

In this game the dragon starts with 3 heads and 3 tails, but you must cut heads and tails in a certain sequence, or you lose the game. Can you guess the correct sequence?
