# Dragongame

A game to kill an evil dragon, in Python 3. The version in the main branch is the same as the one in the "Tests" branch, which works fine, but other ideas were under implementation. Therefore, the version in "Tests2" branch is incomplete. At the moment, this project is not receiving updates.

In this game the dragon starts with 3 heads and 3 tails, but you must cut heads and tails in a certain sequence, or you lose the game.
